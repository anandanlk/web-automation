# web-automation

This repository provides standard libraries for web automation using the Python Selenium framework. It is integrated with Robot Framework to enable a keyword-driven automation framework and generate reports.

Note: The framework can be used now, but there are a few missing Selenium libraries, and I will continue to add more libraries.
